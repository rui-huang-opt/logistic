# Logistic Project

This project contains scripts and tools for generating experimental data and implementing asynchronous distributed optimization algorithms.

## Features

- Generate data for experiments.
- Implement distributed optimization techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone /home/rui/python_projects/logistic
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd logistic
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Linux/macOS:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
5. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
